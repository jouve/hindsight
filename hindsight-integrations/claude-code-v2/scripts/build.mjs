// builtins. If tsup code-splitting ever gets re-enabled (shared code moves to
// a sibling "./chunk-*.js") or a hook's source picks up a real npm dependency,
// the copied file would reference something we didn't bring along and would
// only fail at runtime, in a live Claude Code session. Catch it here instead.
// mcp-server.js DOES depend on npm packages (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, zod) —
// tsup's `noExternal` (see hindsight-coding-agents/tsup.config.ts) inlines their
// source directly into the bundle, so it still imports nothing but Node
// builtins and passes this same check unmodified. If a future SDK version adds
// a dependency that can't be inlined and this guard starts failing ONLY for
// mcp-server.js, exempt it specifically here rather than weakening the check
// for the hook bundles below, which must stay strictly Node-builtins-only.
